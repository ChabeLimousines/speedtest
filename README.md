speedtest
=========

This is a simple NodeJS http "internet" speed test. The aim to make it easy to run a http speedtest over your own WAN, VPN, or whatever network. 

Run
=========
node .\speed.js

Open your browser and go to http://hostname:8080/.


Observations/Bugs

I seem to get max out at about 20MBps when using localhost on my Ubuntu laptop and about 5 on my Windows 8 laptop.
